# food-delivery-service
In collaboration with my peers and under guidance of faculty, created food aggregator service with Python as front-and and MySQL as back-end provision. Identified several novel features for ease of use and efficient supply management. Utilized PyQt as GUI toolkit and LiClipse as Interface IDE.
